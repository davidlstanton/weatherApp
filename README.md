# Code Test Weather App
### Description:  
An iOS code test - building an MVP for a weather app to enable people to pack appropriately when they going on holiday.  The company name, user story, acceptance ctiteria and checklist as supplied have intentionally been omitted.

### In short: 

* The App should summarise the forecast for the next week to enable people to pack appropriately
* The test is bound to 8 hours work (starting 12:50 8/5/2017)
* Should use openweathermap.org api's
* Can use 3rd party libraries
* Should be implemented following TDD
* Should not be over engineered
* Should run in a simulator

### High level approach

* Look at OpenWeatherApi, understand what is needed to get info (login e.t.c.), work out which endpoints we will need.
* Sketch out the user journey on a white board, mvp so this should be the simplest version of that journey.
* Sketch out the design (UI) 
* Design the networking stack
* Will we need a caching layer, where should this sit, what rules should it follow.
* Mix eggs and bake.
